		<p id="content7"> Dasara is the most extravagant festival of Mysore. This festival has been celebrated in Mysore with great pomp and show since centuries. This tradition is still carried on though the scale of the celebrations has been watered down. The Dasara festival is celebrated in the months of September and October each year. According to Hindu mythology the festival celebrates and commemorates the victory of Goddess Chamundeshwari after slaying the demon Mahishasura and the triumph of good over evil. The Dasara festivities have become an integral part of the culture and life in Mysore. </br>

		A two-month long Dasara Exhibition is held at the Doddakere Maidan, in which several business and industrial houses take part. Apart from this a Food and Film festival is also organized. During the festivities special religious ceremonies are held at different temples in Mysore especially the Chamundeshwari Temple on top of the Chamundi Hills. The high point of the Dasra celebrations is the Vijayadashami procession held on the tenth day. The finale of the celebrations is the state organized procession consisting of floats, the police and their bands, mounted guards in royal livery and folk artists and musicians. </p></td></br>
